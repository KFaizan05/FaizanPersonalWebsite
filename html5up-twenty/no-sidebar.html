										<p><b>HackUTDx: GoBaby</b><br>
											Our web app ensures the safety and comfort of a baby during car journeys. By utlizing tools such as Python, React JS, and some Machine Learning models, we developed the initial production of this application.
											When the vehicle starts, an in-cabin camera detects if a baby is on-board. The system then maintains a safe rear cabin temperature, preventing heat exhaustion in summer and hypothermia in winter. 
											It monitors the baby's sleep and alerts the driver to exercise caution, activates blind spot and lane assist, and plays white noise to keep the baby asleep. 
											Crucially, if a baby is left unattended, the car's alarm will sound after one minute to alert those nearby.
